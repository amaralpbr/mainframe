# Welcome to My Mainframe and Assembly Language Playground!

Hello! This repository is my personal learning space where I'm exploring the fascinating world of mainframes and Assembly language. Consider this my digital notebook, filled with notes, code experiments, and resources I find helpful.

**Important Note:** I'm a mainframe enthusiast and a lifelong learner, but definitely not an expert! This repository is purely for my own educational journey. I'm not providing professional instruction, consulting, or any form of official guidance. It's all about passion and curiosity here!

**What you might find (if you dare to peek!):**

* **My learning notes:**  My interpretations and summaries of mainframe concepts, z/Architecture, and Assembly language.
* **Code experiments:**  My attempts at writing Assembly programs (expect some bugs and "aha!" moments).
* **Useful resources:**  Links to articles, tutorials, and IBM documentation that I find valuable.

**Feel free to explore, but remember:**

* This is a personal learning space, so the content may be incomplete or contain errors.
* I'm always learning, so expect things to change and evolve.
* If you find something useful, that's great! But please don't consider this a definitive source of information.

This repository is my mainframe hobby hub - a place to tinker, experiment, and learn. Enjoy the journey!
